    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Car Project</strong> was created to simplify how people 
      explore, compare, and connect with vehicles. Our mission is to build 
      a transparent and user-friendly hub for car enthusiasts, buyers, and sellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choosing a car isn’t just about the purchase – it’s about the journeys 
      you’ll take. That’s why we provide expert insights, verified dealerships, 
      and a trusted platform to help you make confident decisions.
